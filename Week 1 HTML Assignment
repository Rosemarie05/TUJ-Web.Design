    <h1>HTML</h1>
      <p>
         HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. Hypertext Markup Language is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. HTML describes the structure of a web page.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hypertext refers to links that connect web pages to one another,
        either within a single website or between websites. Browsers do not
        display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the
        page.

    <h3>HTML tags</h3>
    An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags".
    <p>
      Tags consist of the element name surrounded by "<" and ">". Many browsers
      have default styles for the appearance of the document based on the
      meaning of the tag.
      <br />
      HTML5, the current standard for HTML, has roughly 100 tags.
